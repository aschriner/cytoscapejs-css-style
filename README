This little package allows you to define the stylesheet for a cytoscape.js graph in native css format (instead of the funky JSON/CSS mixture that cytoscape.js asks for (defined here: http://cytoscape.github.io/cytoscape.js/#style).  You write the style in CSS, then run the parser to generate the JSON.

The file "cytoscapecssparser.py" should be placed in the same directory as a file called "cytoscape.css", which should contain valid CSS rules for styling a cytoscape.js visualization.  It will generate a json file called "cytoscapestyle.json" in the same directory.  

Run "python cytoscapecssparser.py" from a command line (with Python installed, obviously) to generate the json file.  

In cytoscape.js, you can load the generated json file like this:

$("#cy").cytoscape({
    ...
    style: function(){
            var json = null
            $.ajax({
                'async': false,
                'global': false,
                'url': 'css/cytoscapestyle.json',
                'dataType': "json",
                'success': function (data) {
                    json = data;
                }
            })
            return json
        }()
    ...
})

*Be advised loading the json file won't work if you are running from a local file!  You at least need to set up a server like http://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html
